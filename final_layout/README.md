Here is the project for the course IE500417 - Data Processing And Visualization

There are 3 steps to run the project : 
1. Run geo_mapv2.py : it generates a df.pickle file from the url of the covid data, that will be useful to make the next step a bit quicker
2. Run index.py : it is the file launching our server and thus our visualization tool 
3. Copy paste in your browser the address shown in the console. If needed, the address is http://127.0.0.1:9877/ 
You now have access to the tool and can explore the data as you wish.
